Cluster Crate is a hobby project that aims to combine some ideas found in my PhD projects in one package. The goal is to be able to generate cluster structures and optimise their geometries with pair potentials such as Lennard-Jones. I am also aiming to extend this project with a web UI using WebGL. As I am targeting WASM I am writing this from scratch in Rust.

THIS IS AN EARLY WIP PROJECT!
